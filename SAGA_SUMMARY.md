# Choreography Saga Implementation Summary

## ✅ Implementation Complete

A fully functional **Choreography Saga Pattern** has been implemented using RabbitMQ for distributed transaction management across microservices.

## 📦 What Was Built

### 1. Shared Messaging Infrastructure

- **File**: `shared/messaging/rabbitmq.js`
- Reusable RabbitMQ connection management
- Publisher and consumer utilities
- Automatic message acknowledgment
- Error handling and graceful shutdown

### 2. Order Service Saga

- **Files**:
   - `order-service/saga/orderSaga.js` (new)
   - `order-service/services/orderService.js` (refactored)
   - `order-service/index.js` (updated)
- Publishes `OrderCreated` events
- Listens for `InventoryReserved` and `InventoryFailed` events
- Implements compensating transactions
- Updates order status based on inventory results

### 3. Product Service Event Handler

- **Files**:
   - `product-service/events/orderEventHandler.js` (new)
   - `product-service/index.js` (updated)
- Listens for `OrderCreated` events
- Validates and deducts inventory
- Publishes `InventoryReserved` on success
- Publishes `InventoryFailed` on failure

### 4. Notification Service Event Handler

- **Files**:
   - `notification-service/events/orderEventHandler.js` (new)
   - `notification-service/index.js` (updated)
- Listens for `InventoryReserved` and `InventoryFailed` events
- Sends success/failure email notifications
- Non-blocking (failures don't break the saga)

### 5. Dependencies Added

- `amqplib@^0.10.4` added to:
   - order-service/package.json
   - product-service/package.json
   - notification-service/package.json

### 6. Documentation

- **SAGA_ARCHITECTURE.md** - Complete architectural documentation
- **SAGA_SETUP_GUIDE.md** - Step-by-step setup and testing guide
- **This summary** - Quick reference

## 🔄 Saga Flow

### Success Path

```
1. User creates order
   └─> Order Service creates order (status: Pending)
   └─> Publishes OrderCreated event

2. Product Service receives OrderCreated
   └─> Validates and deducts stock
   └─> Publishes InventoryReserved event

3. Order Service receives InventoryReserved
   └─> Updates order status to Processing

4. Notification Service receives InventoryReserved
   └─> Sends success email notification
```

### Failure Path (Compensating Transaction)

```
1. User creates order
   └─> Order Service creates order (status: Pending)
   └─> Publishes OrderCreated event

2. Product Service receives OrderCreated
   └─> Tries to deduct stock but fails (insufficient)
   └─> Publishes InventoryFailed event

3. Order Service receives InventoryFailed
   └─> Updates order status to Failed (COMPENSATION)

4. Notification Service receives InventoryFailed
   └─> Sends failure email notification
```

## 🎯 Key Features

### ✓ Event-Driven Architecture

- Services communicate through events, not direct calls
- Loose coupling between services
- Asynchronous processing

### ✓ Compensating Transactions

- Automatic rollback on failures
- Order marked as "Failed" when inventory cannot be reserved
- No partial state inconsistencies

### ✓ Resilient Messaging

- Durable exchanges and queues
- Message persistence
- Automatic acknowledgment after successful processing
- Reject and don't requeue on processing errors

### ✓ Service Autonomy

- Each service manages its own logic
- No central orchestrator
- Independent scaling

### ✓ Observable

- Comprehensive logging with emojis
- RabbitMQ Management UI for monitoring
- Clear event flow tracking

## 📊 RabbitMQ Configuration

### Exchanges

| Exchange           | Type  | Purpose                  |
| ------------------ | ----- | ------------------------ |
| order_exchange     | topic | Order-related events     |
| inventory_exchange | topic | Inventory-related events |

### Queues

| Queue              | Subscriber           | Bound To           | Pattern       |
| ------------------ | -------------------- | ------------------ | ------------- |
| order_saga_queue   | Order Service        | inventory_exchange | inventory.\*  |
| inventory_queue    | Product Service      | order_exchange     | order.created |
| notification_queue | Notification Service | inventory_exchange | inventory.\*  |

### Events

| Event              | Publisher       | Subscribers         | Purpose                          |
| ------------------ | --------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| order.created      | Order Service   | Product Service     | Trigger inventory reservation    |
| inventory.reserved | Product Service | Order, Notification | Confirm successful reservation   |
| inventory.failed   | Product Service | Order, Notification | Trigger compensating transaction |

## 🚀 How to Use

### Start the system:

```bash
docker-compose up rabbitmq mongo-orders mongo-products \
  order-service product-service notification-service
```

### Test success scenario:

```bash
# Create a product with stock
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/products \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Test", "price": 50, "category": "Test", "stock": 100}'

# Place an order
curl -X POST http://localhost:5003/api/orders/user123 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"items": [{"productId": "PRODUCT_ID", "quantity": 2}]}'
```

### Monitor:

- **RabbitMQ UI**: http://localhost:15672 (admin/admin123)
- **Service Logs**: Watch console output for event flow
